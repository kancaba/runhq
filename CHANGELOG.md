## [0.2.0](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/compare/v0.1.3...v0.2.0) (2026-04-20)

This release is a major UX polish pass on the Quick Action palette plus
robust cross-platform editor detection — "Open in VS Code / Cursor /
Windsurf" now works reliably even when the CLI shim isn't on `$PATH`,
and the command palette finally reads like a native macOS Spotlight-
class overlay.

### Features

* **editors:** cross-platform editor detection on macOS, Windows, and
  Linux — scans canonical install locations (`/Applications`,
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs`, `/snap/bin`, `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin`,
  `/opt/<app>/<app>`) instead of relying on `$PATH`. VS Code, Cursor,
  and Windsurf are now discovered for users who never ran the manual
  "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" step.
  ([dfa2391](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/dfa23913c2cac8d80f730d9808e08db5c27106cf))
* **quick-action:** native-feeling command palette overhaul.
  ([a866eeb](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/a866eeb40e098322d6367f09dce95bf3bf96f511),
  [07eba03](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/07eba0390628a4353d1b792926dd70957dd7a17d))
  * Re-centers on the monitor owning the main RunHQ window on every
    show, with the window size clamped to the monitor's logical bounds
    so the palette never renders off-screen on 13" MacBook Air
    (1280×800) setups.
  * Panel is vertically centered with a subtle upward bias (Raycast /
    Spotlight convention) instead of the previous top-anchored
    `pt-[18vh]` layout.
  * Native-feeling search input: 15px type, tighter letter-spacing,
    `autoCorrect` / `autoCapitalize` disabled so service and command
    names aren't auto-munged while typing.
  * The perpetual accent-colored focus ring that the global
    `*:focus-visible` rule was drawing around the always-focused input
    is suppressed via unlayered CSS — correctly beating Tailwind v4's
    `@layer utilities` emission model.
  * Removed the redundant right-side kbd hints (`↹ filter` / `← back`)
    next to the input — the footer already surfaces the same shortcuts
    and the duplication was pure visual noise.

### Bug Fixes

* **quick-action:** restore first action row + add "Actions" section
  header — fixes two tightly-coupled palette bugs: the first
  app-action ("Open RunHQ") being clipped by the filter bar border on
  mount (the cursor-sync `scrollIntoView` was scrolling it out of
  view), and app-actions silently bleeding into Stacks/Services
  without a grouping label. Actions / Stacks / Services now read as
  three distinct bands.
  ([5c612f8](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/5c612f8cba7c67f841f3ce75ed3a693939efe9cf))
* **quick-action:** suppress the macOS show/key-window blur race — the
  palette no longer opens and immediately closes itself when triggered
  while the main RunHQ window is focused. A 250ms post-show grace
  window now swallows the transient `Focused(false)` event that
  transparent/borderless NSWindows fire between `show()` returning and
  the window actually becoming the key window. Same pattern Raycast /
  Alfred / Spotlight use; legitimate click-away dismissal is
  preserved.
  ([d4cc6c9](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/d4cc6c973dc6da5230184c9ce85301f94490524a))
* **quick-action:** "padding never works" class of layout bugs — the
  legacy `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box }`
  universal reset has been removed from `quick-action.html`. Root
  cause: Tailwind v4 emits utilities into `@layer utilities`, and
  unlayered CSS unconditionally beats layered CSS regardless of
  specificity — so the universal reset was silently nuking every
  `px-*` / `py-*` / `m-*` utility in the palette window. Tailwind's
  preflight, which lives inside a layer, now handles the
  normalization properly.
  ([07eba03](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/07eba0390628a4353d1b792926dd70957dd7a17d))
* **editors:** resolve CLI shims outside of the GUI-launch PATH — when
  RunHQ.app is launched from Finder or the Dock it only inherits
  `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`, so `which code` / `which cursor`
  silently returned "not found" and the Editor dropdown rendered
  empty. Now probes `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
  `~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/bin` directly and passes the
  resolved absolute path to `tokio::process::Command` so launches work
  even from minimal-PATH contexts.
  ([c7b0275](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/c7b02750798879867e544e0ac330b17c29a25a1a))
* **docs:** stop stranding Cloudflare Pages visitors on stale
  `style.css` — `docs/_headers` shipped
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for `/*.css`,
  `/*.png`, `/*.svg`. `immutable` is only safe on fingerprinted URLs —
  our docs site uses stable filenames, so after the 0.2.0 rebuild the
  Amsterdam CF edge was returning the 2h-old pre-rebuild CSS (no
  `hero-maas` styles, 54.3 KB) while Düsseldorf had the fresh one
  (56.2 KB), collapsing the "Built with GLM on Huawei Cloud MaaS"
  hero badge to an unstyled default anchor depending on which edge
  the visitor hit. Headers now use a short TTL plus
  `stale-while-revalidate`, and the `<link>` carries a `?v=0.2.0`
  cache-bust so every already-poisoned edge re-fetches from origin.
  ([a2de7d3](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/a2de7d30d4c7c7ab748072ec229de749177b3540))

### Dependencies

* **tailwind-merge:** 2.6.1 → 3.5.0 — aligns conflict resolution with
  Tailwind v4's utility emission model.
  ([07eba03](https://github.com/erdembas/runhq/commit/07eba0390628a4353d1b792926dd70957dd7a17d))
